# Arya.ai Assignemnt June 2022

Hello there! This is my submission for the Arya.ai - Data Scientist Assignement Round.

# About Me

Hi! My name is Shikhar Shukla, a machine learning engineer and today I am trying to attempt to do an EDA on the dataset which is provided to me by Arya.ai as an assignment.

# The Assignment

The problem statement is as follows:

> Binary Classification - Do an exploratory analysis of the dataset provided, and decide on feature selection, and preprocessing before training a model to classify as class ‘0’ or class ‘1’

Right off the bat we can say that in this assignment, we will have to apply classical Machine Learning algorithms to train a simple classification model for binary prediction.
